		"description": "Thanks for playing with OUR mod, there is some info on how to get started:\n\n • Firstly, get some wood and plastic that's floating on sea and craft the Hammer.\n\n • Hammer has been nerfed, so it can't cut trees anymore, it also does less damage.\n\n • Best way to get food and loot is by fishing, you can craft fishing rod in the Workbench, then cast it into the ocean and wait for a splash particle, then pull it back.\n\n • Also, don't forget about threats! Such as sharks and other, not so good sea creatures."
